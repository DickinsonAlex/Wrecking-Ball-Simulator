# üèóÔ∏è Wrecking Ball Simulator ‚Äì Real-Time Demolition Physics

This project is a physics-based simulation of a wrecking ball built in C++ using NVIDIA PhysX. The player operates a mobile crane equipped with a wrecking ball, aiming to demolish a destructible wall. The simulation showcases dynamic collision response, articulated vehicle control, and a custom win condition‚Äîall designed for high-performance real-time interaction.

‚úÖ Core Features
- Player-Controlled Crane: Drive and rotate the crane base and arm to aim the wrecking ball
- Destructible Structure: PhysX-based wall composed of destructible elements that collapse under impact
- Dynamic Camera: Follows the crane as it moves across the simulation area
- Win Condition: The game ends successfully once 60% of the wall is destroyed

üß† Enhancements
- Segmented Crane Rotation: Independent control of chassis and upper segment for precision swings
- Interactive Physics: Ball can be swung or rammed directly into the wall for varied effects
- Realistic Reference Model: Movement and design inspired by the CATERPILLAR 324E excavator

üß™ Technical Skills
C++ ‚Ä¢ PhysX SDK ‚Ä¢ Rigid Body Physics ‚Ä¢ Jointed Articulations ‚Ä¢ Real-Time Simulation
